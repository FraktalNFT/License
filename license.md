Box 3159, Road Town, Tortola, British Virgin Island (**“Fraktal”**), has developed a proprietary source-available software for NFT fractionalization (**“Software”**), with its source code published and made available to the general public (the source code to the Software or any part thereof hereinafter referred to as “**Code**”).

The fact, that the Code was published, cannot be interpreted as a waiver of any proprietary rights of Fraktal to the Software, nor does it make the Software open-source or free to use. The Software and/or the Code, any copy or derivative work thereof, may be used, modified, or distributed only under license terms set forth below.

The Software and/or the Code can be used for free under License for Review Purposes, when used for assessment or testing. Any other use, especially commercial use for the fractionalization of NFTs, is governed under License for Using the Software and is subject to royalties and other limitations set forth below.

**License for Review Purposes**

This License for Review Purposes governs use of the Code, or any part thereof, by any person/entity, who accesses the Code for review purposes (“Reviewer”), under terms and subject to conditions set forth under this License for Review Purposes. By taking advantage of these rights to access and review the Code, the Reviewer accepts terms of this License for Review Purposes. The Reviewer, who does not accept the License for Review Purposes, is forbidden to access and review the Code.

License Terms

Subject to the terms of License for Review Purposes, Fraktal grants the Reviewer a nontransferable, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to access and use the Code solely for accessing, testing and otherwise reviewing the Code as a reference, and/or for the sole purpose of analyzing it for defect, bug, backdoor, security issue or other deficiency in the Code (review purposes). The Reviewer is entitled to use the Software under this license for a period of time necessary to fulfill the review purposes. The Reviewer is not entitled to use or do anything with the Code for any commercial or other purpose, other than for review purposes.

Provision of the Code to Third Persons

The Reviewer may provide the Code to anyone else and publish excerpts of it for the purposes of review and commentary, provided that when the Reviewer does so, he makes any recipient of the Code aware of the terms of License for Review Purposes and License for Using the Software and that he attributes the Software and the Code to Fraktal.

**License for Using the Software**

This License for Using the Software governs use of the Software and/or the Code, or any part thereof, for any other than review purposes under License for Review Purposes by any person/entity using the Software and/or the Code (“**User**”). By using the Software and/or the Code for other than review purposes, the User accepts the terms of the License for Using the Software as set forth below. The User who does not accept the License for Using the Software, is forbidden to use the Software and/or the Code.

License Terms

The User, subject to and conditioned upon such User’s acceptance of and adherence to the terms of this License for Using the Software, is hereby granted:

License to Use the Software

a non-transferable, nonexclusive, perpetual (subject to a change or termination by Fraktal), worldwide, non-sublicensable license to use the Software and/or the Code for its intended purpose which is fractionalization of NFTs and other digital assets and distributing parts of royalties to fraktion (i.e., a piece of an NFT that is fractionalized) owners; and

License to Create Derivative Work

a non-transferable, nonexclusive, perpetual (subject to a change or a termination by Fraktal), worldwide, non-sublicensable license to use the Software and/or the Code to create software or other works derived from the Software and/or the Code **by modifying the Software and/or the Code including copying from or adapting the Software and/or the Code or their parts or by combining the Software and/or the Code or their parts with other work or by including the Software and/the Code or their parts in a collection (“Derivative Work”)**, provided such Derivative Works will be distributed and used in a way that effectively adheres to the relevant part of terms and conditions of this License for Using the Software concerning: (i) license fee: the end users of the Derivative Work will pay to Fraktal a license fee under terms of this License for Using the Software; and (ii) right to attribution: licensor or distributor of the Derivative Work will attribute the Software and the Code as a part of the Derivative Work to Fraktal and will make any recipient of the Derivative Work aware of the terms of the License for Review Purposes and the License for Using the Software.

In the case that any User intends to create a Derivative Work, which for any reason does not enable Fraktal an automatic collection and disbursement of a license fee under terms of this License for Using the Software (e.g., Derivative Work will not facilitate transactions with digital assets processed through smart contracts), such User will contact Fraktal, and the terms of a license fee will be agreed in a specific license agreement. Prior to the execution of a specific license agreement with Fraktal, the User is forbidden to create a Derivative Work, which would not enable effective payment and collection of the license fee under terms of this License for Using the Software.

License Fee

Any User as a licensee will pay the license fee of all payments and transactions relating to any assets the Software, the Code or any Derivative Work is used to transfer or otherwise disposed with, to Fraktal as licensor (“**License Fee**”), in the amount of: *

* different percentage (%) amounts can be agreed upon between Fraktal and User on a case-by-case basis.

Daily transaction volume will be determined as a sum of value of transactions processed through smart contracts on DLT systems, which are part of the Software (“Smart Contracts”) performed on the order of User during a calendar day (GMT time zone).

E.g.: Daily transaction volume amounts to the USD 15,000,000, the license fee will be USD 75,000 (i.e.: 0,5% of 15,000,000 = USD 75,000)

The License fees will be processed through Smart Contracts and the User as a licensee authorizes the automatic collection and disbursement of the License Fee. The User agrees and understands that the License Fee will be transferred, processed, or initiated directly through the Smart Contracts on DLT systems. By using the Software and/or the Code, the User hereby acknowledges, consents to, and accepts the License Fee and its execution and distribution.

In the case that the License Fee cannot be collected and disbursed automatically, as specified above, the User will pay the License Fee in cryptocurrency/digital asset used for payment on a network Smart Contracts are deployed on, to the Fraktal’s address for receiving payments in pertinent cryptocurrency/digital asset listed on Fraktal’s GitHub website:
https://github.com/FraktalNFT/License/blob/main/PAYMENT_ADDRESSES
In the case that the list of Fraktal’s addresses for receiving payments does not contain address for receiving payments in pertinent cryptocurrency/digital asset, the User will notify Fraktal via info@fraktal.io and the method of License Fee payment will be agreed between Fraktal and User.

The License Fee will be paid for any payments and transactions relating to any assets the Software, the Code or any Derivative Work is used to transfer or otherwise disposed with, irrespective, whether it is the first transfer of a digital asset, or further transfer made on secondary markets with pertinent digital assets. The exhaustion of intellectual property rights or first sale defense or argument will not apply to Fraktal’s copyrights or other intellectual property rights to the Software and/or the Code, or, if not applicable, exhaustion of intellectual property rights or first sale defense will only apply to the minimum extent permitted by law.

Modification of the Software

Under the terms of the License to Create Derivative Work and for the sole purpose of Derivative Work creation, Fraktal grants the User the right to:
make changes and/or modifications of the Software or its metadata or to combine it with other software or to include it in a collective work; and 
right to copy, translate, decompile, modify or change the Software and/or the Code in order to understand its functionality.

**General Terms for Licenses**

No Trademark License 

Neither the License for Review Purposes, nor the License for Using the Software (collectively referred to as “Licenses”), grants the Reviewer or the User any rights to use Fraktal’s name, logo, or trademarks, nor the right in any way indicate he is authorized to speak or act on behalf of Fraktal.

Limitation of Fraktal’s Liability for the Software and the Code

THE CODE IS MADE AVAILABLE "AS-IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OF IMPLIED GUARANTEES AS TO FITNESS, MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT OR OTHERWISE. ANYONE ACCESSING THE SOFTWARE/CODE SHOULD HAVE THE REQUISITE EXPERTISE TO SECURE THEIR OWN SYSTEM AND DEVICES AND TO ACCESS AND USE THE SOFTWARE/CODE. USER/REVIEWER BEARS THE RISK OF ACCESSING AND USING THE SOFTWARE/CODE. IN PARTICULAR, FRAKTAL BEARS NO LIABILITY FOR ANY INTERFERENCE WITH OR ADVERSE EFFECT ON REVIEWER’S/USER’S SYSTEM OR DEVICES AS A RESULT OF ACCESSING AND USING THE SOFTWARE/CODE.

Certain Technology Risks Connected with Using the Software

As a part of the Software/Code, cryptographic and blockchain technologies, including cryptocurrencies and other digital assets, smart contracts, and decentralized networks or systems, are utilized. Such technologies are novel, experimental, and speculative, and therefore there is significant uncertainty regarding their operation, effects and risks.

The Software/Code and Smart Contracts may be affected by hacking, theft, attacks, malfunctions, defects, bugs, or changes to the protocol rules of network they are deployed on.

Transactions processed through Smart Contracts are subject to the immutable nature of the DLT systems and may not be reversed and are final and non-refundable once they are confirmed on the DLT system.

User is responsible for generating and storing his own private keys associated with digital assets which are disposed with on networks Smart Contracts are deployed on.

AS A RESULT OF FOREGOING MATTERS, USER MAY BE EXPOSED TO A RISK OF AN IRREVERSIBLE LOSS OF HIS DIGITAL ASSETS WHILE USING THE SOFTWARE, THE CODE, OR ANY DERIVATIVE WORK, FOR WHICH FRAKTAL ASSUMES NO LIABILITY.

Limitation of Fraktal’s Liability for User’s Content

Fraktal makes no representations or warranties as to the quality, origin, price, or ownership of any content transferred, processed, or initiated through the Smart Contracts or otherwise disposed with using the Software (“**User’s Content**”). Fraktal shall not be liable for any errors, misrepresentations, or omissions in, of, and about, the User’s Content, nor for the availability of the User’s Content. Fraktal shall not be liable for any losses, injuries, or damages from the purchase, inability to purchase, display, or use of User’s Content.

Interpretation of Disclaimers of Warranty and Limitation of Liability

If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability of Fraktal in connection with the Software, the Code and/or any Derivative Work, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Software or the Code in return for a special fee (in addition to the License Fee).

Prohibited Use

Using the Software, Code or any Derivative Work in relation with any illegal material is prohibited and constitutes material violation of these license terms.

Termination

The Reviewer/User may not use or modify the Software and/or the Code except as expressly provided under these license terms. Any attempt to use or modify the Software and/or the Code otherwise is void, and will automatically terminate Reviewer’s/User’s rights under these license terms. Any rights granted under these license terms will automatically terminate upon any other violation of these license terms as well.

Fraktal is entitled to terminate any rights granted under these license terms, upon its sole discretion, with one month notice period.

Change of Licenses Terms

Fraktal may suspend, terminate or vary the terms of Licenses and any access to the Software and/or the Code at any time, without notice, for any reason or no reason, in respect of any licensee, group of licensees or all licensees.

Governing Law and Dispute Resolution

License terms shall be governed by law of Czech Republic. All disputes arising from the License terms and/or in connection with it shall be finally decided with the Arbitration Court attached to the Czech Chamber of Commerce and the Agricultural Chamber of the Czech Republic according to its Rules by three arbitrators in accordance with the Rules of that Arbitration Court. The seat of the arbitration will be Prague, and the arbitral proceedings will be conducted in English.
